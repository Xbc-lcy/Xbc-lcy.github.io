I will be a PhD student at School of Information Science and Electronic Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, advised by [Prof. Xiaohua Tian](https://xtian.sjtu.edu.cn/) 

Prior to this, I am graduating from Shanghai Jiao Tong University with a Bachelor's degree in Information Engineering in 2026.

My current research focuses on Ultra-Low Power Wireless Systems. I'm also very interested in leveraging AI for communication system design and improving communication system performance.
